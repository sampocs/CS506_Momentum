# CS506_Momentum
Daily habit tracker

The master branch contains the code we want to submit for iteration 1.
Instructions on how to build and run the application:
1.	Go to the `releases` on the main page of the repository
2.	Click on the `Iteration 2` release
3.	Download the source code and unzip
4.	Navigate to the root directory of the downloaded folder
5.	Type “npm install” to install tools for building the app
6.	Once installation finishes, type npm start. This should open up an expo address on the localhost with a QR code. This can be scanned through the expo app on any mobile device. Alternatively, expo can be run with an iOS emulator on the computer.
7.	The application should now be running, complete with all tests enabled.
