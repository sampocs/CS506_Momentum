# CS506_Momentum
Daily habit tracker

The master branch contains the code we want to submit for iteration 1.
Instructions on how to build and run the application:
1.	Go to a directory of your choice.
2.	In cmd, type “git clone https://github.com/sampocs/CS506_Momentum”
3.	Navigate to the CS506_Momentum folder
4.	Type “git pull” to ensure you have the latest version
5.	Type “npm install” to install tools for building the app
6.	Once installation finishes, type npm start. This should open up an expo address on the localhost with a QR code. This can be scanned through the expo app on any mobile device. Alternatively, expo can be run with an iOS emulator on the computer.
7.	The application should now be running, complete with all tests enabled.
